It finds code beween $$ and $$ and replaces it with an image generated with the service http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html. It turns your formula into a picture when you submit the Blip. When you start editing a Blip the picture turns into code again. As far as I know this is the only LaTex robot that enables editing a formula without using a gadget. (at 2010-03-09) Written using Java and the v2 Robot API\r\nDemonstrates editing blips, inserting Images, using annotations, storing in DataDocument using filters and contexts, using installer for annotating\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/master-lincoln/LincTex/raw/master/img/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nOrigin\r\n-------\r\nThis is a robot that I created in the earlier times of GoogleWave. It's uploaded here for reference. Original Google Code repository can be found [HERE](http://code.google.com/p/linctex/).\r\n\r\n"}
