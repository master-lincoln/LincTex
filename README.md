LincTex
==============
[Visit Project description in Google Wave Sample Gallery](http://wave-samples-gallery.appspot.com/about_app?app_id=116001)

Functionality
-------------
A simple robot that renders LaTeX code in a wave. It finds code beween $$ and $$ and replaces it with an image generated with the service http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html. It turns your formula into a picture when you submit the Blip. When you start editing a Blip the picture turns into code again. As far as I know this is the only LaTex robot that enables editing a formula without using a gadget. (at 2010-03-09) Written using Java and the v2 Robot API
Demonstrates editing blips, inserting Images, using annotations, storing in DataDocument using filters and contexts, using installer for annotating


Origin
-------
This is a robot that I created in the earlier times of GoogleWave. It's uploaded here for reference. Original google Code repository can be found [HERE](http://code.google.com/p/linctex/).
